## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using supervised machine learning techniques:

- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Post-Pruned Decision Tree  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The dataset used is the classic Heart Disease Dataset, containing relevant health metrics of patients.
